# dishCrawl
 A spider that get all the urls of dishes and then exacts complete detail about that and then stores them in JSON file. I use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to collect recipes from a food website and store them in a structured format in a database. The two tasks involved in collecting the recipes are:
- Get all the recipe urls from the website using selenium
- Convert the html information of a recipe webpage into a structed json using beautiful soup.
For our task, I picked the [NDTV food](https://food.ndtv.com/recipes) as a source for extracting recipes.
